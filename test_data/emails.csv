We hope you're well and keeping safe during this time. I'm emailing you regarding an update for the society elections. Due to the current situation, we have reviewed all society election results that were not quorate as the Society Coordinators will be on furlough from Monday 20th April. This should not impact the society in getting set up for the next academic year. 
The following results have been ratified: 
President: Chris Chia
Treasurer: Eldric Lem
Secretary: Rafay Butt
Congratulations! 
The decision to ratify these results is to ensure that the society continues into the next year. Michaelmas Term Elections will be organised for any outstanding roles required. 
For any further support or queries please contact su.arcstaff@lse.ac.uk as there will be staff still monitoring this inbox during the next three weeks. Please note, our response time to emails and inquiries may be slightly delayed during this time.
Best wishes, 
The Societies Team "

  Thank you to those who nominated themselves or voted in the election. We hope you’re all looking after yourselves and staying safe! 
  The society election has finished and we are due to announce results, unfortunately we were not able to ratify the election results as the society did not meet quoracy. Quoracy is 10 members, or 10% of the total membership, whichever is greater, but because the society did not reach the minimum number of voters, the election will be run again. 
  The election will be the same positions as this round, with set dates for new nominations and voting. Any candidates already nominated in this election will be automatically transferred over to the new election. 
If you have any questions about this please let us know by contacting su.arcstaff@lse.ac.uk. 
  We will be in touch with the current committee regarding dates for nominations and voting at a later date, so if you didn’t vote this time around, please do make sure you get involved in the next election!
  Best wishes 
The Societies Team."

We have been contacted by LSE Digital Skills Lab for a coding challenge based on financial analysis for those who are new to Python. 
This coding challenge will be hosted in conjunction with a global consultancy firm who will be unveiled in due course alongside more detailed information.
The stages consist of an online Python course to ensure eligibility for the coding challenge.
The Python course will be available for those who wish to enter the challenge until March 1st 2020. Following this, all those who have completed the course will be randomly allocated into teams and sent the coding problem set. 
Teams then will have 4 weeks to work together in solving the challenge with a formal presentation to the DSL team and the global corporation before Easter.
Certificates will be issued to all participants and prizes for the top 2/3 teams.
Here is more information:
Firstly, in order to take part in the Coding Challenge, you will need to complete our prerequisite course: Introduction to Python for Data Science (https://courses.digitalskills.lse.ac.uk/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT208x+CodingChallenge_LT20/about) by 1st March 2020.
Whichever way you choose to organise your learning, be mindfully aware that the recommended time to dedicate to this course is 12-24 hours, and the final exam can take up to 4 hours. You will need to achieve an overall mark of 70% to pass this course. 
The Digital Skills Lab, as always, will be there to support your learning. They run Python drop-in sessions at the LSE LIFE booths every Thursday (11 am till noon).

More specific details about the coding challenge will be available soon to those who register for the course.
For any other queries, the team can be reached at Digital.Skills.Lab@lse.ac.uk
Once again, we thank you for your interest in our coding challenge and wish you happy…

Hope you all enjoyed this term so far. I'd like to remind you our first event this term -- Workshop on Nerual Networks for Finance -- will take place tomorrow 6-8 pm.
In the two-hour long workshop, a huge amount of content about deep learning for finance will be covered, and we will go pretty in depth as to the practical side. You will also get an idea of how NNs are different from other algorithms for financial tasks. Alongside, you can take it as a great chance to interact with our instructor, Wian, to get any specific questions answered.
You can expect to have a good understanding of how to deploy neural networks for real work applications and where these algorithms can be applied after the workshop.There will be a competition held based on the material from the workshop for those interested. But no pressure!
This is an open-to-all event so we will be providing both high-level details, but also the exact code for implementation in TensorFlow. See you there!!

    PROGRAMMES
This year we're planning to run two programmes aiming towards students with different ML backgrounds.
The Industry Mentorship Programme is for people who have enough experience in ML and are comfortable using Python and its common packages. The number of take-in will be from 5 to 7, and the successful candidates will work within a group, mentored by an experienced portfolio manager, who is also a mathematician, an expert in automated quantitative trading. As the applications we received is beyond expectation, there will be interviews going on later this week and next week. You will be contacted via email once you signed up.
  The Data Science Incubator is for people who haven't come across ML but know how to code in Python. You will work in a small team of students with similar experience to you. You will be mentored by another student with knowledge regarding the problem you are working on. The main aim is to teach you the principles of Data Science and Machine Learning and get you applying them straight away by working on a project you care about.

In case you missed it earlier this week, we are re-running elections for our core committee posts, as we did not meet quoracy in the Lent term ML leadership elections. This means you can now vote again for next year's committee on our SU page here. Voting will close this weekend Sunday 12th May at 23:59. 
We kindly ask that you vote, even if you were not able to attend many events during the year, as we will not be able to re-register as a society for the 2019-2020 academic year if quoracy is not met. This would mean that, despite having a fantastic team excited to lead the society next year, ML@LSE may not be able to continue operating unless this week's election is successful.

Now that this process has finished, we can say that your student groups election has not been successful.  This could be for two separate reasons: Your election failed to make Quoracy, or no candidates were running in your election.

A few of you have expressed your confusion about the voting process. It is understandable as it's the first time the SU has implemented such a system. Here is a step-by-step guide to casting your vote for the ML@LSE committee for 2019/20:
1) Open the link to our society on the LSESU website: https://www.lsesu.com/activities/societies/society/12940/
(if the link doesn't work go to lsesu.com and find ""Machine Learning"" under Societies)
You should see the society page like so:
2) Log in using your LSE ID and password on the top right corner of the page.
3) After logging in, scroll down to see the voting section like this one and click VOTE NOW
  4) Rank the candidates accordingly and hit submit. Make sure you've seen the posters and read the manifestos on the fb page before you vote
5) Wait for results coming out next week.
NOTE: You must be a member of the society to vote, otherwise system simply wouldn't let you. Also, even if you are a member, if you joined quite recently, you also may not have voting rights.
Please message us if any questions arise!"

Our 1st bootcamp of the year will be taking place this afternoon at PAR.LG.03, from 4pm to 6pm.
- We aim to cover the general principles of machine learning theories and techniques.
- We also aim to help out with the installation of the Anaconda distribution and the Jupyter Notebook development environment, which we will be using as our implementation environment for all subsequent bootcamps.
- If time permits, we may also introduce some of the packages that we will be using frequently for subsequent bootcamps, such as pandas, numpy and sklearn.
While we are super excited by the overwhelming demand for our bootcamps, we are unfortunately only able to accommodate 60 people due to resoruce limitations. We will try our best to book locations with larger seating capacity for subsequent bootcamps.
If you were unable to get a place this time round, you could come to the location in case some current ticket holders do not attend, but priority will be given to ticket holders.
If you are intending to come to the bootcamp, it would be awesome if you could bring along a charged laptop as we have limiting charging ports.
All material covered during this bootcamp will be posted online on our Github Repository.
We look forward to seeing you this afternoon.

https://www.lsesu.com/messagecentre/message/207099/,6,LT Week 9 Events update,2018-03-04 00:14:00,207,120,"Dear all members,
ML@LSE would be hosting TWO events this coming week:
1. Predicting TfL Congestion with IoT Data
Oliver Gindele, Head of ML at Datatonic (https://datatonic.com/), will be sharing with us a project on predicting London Congestion with TfL Sensor Data.

Predicting congestion is an important part of any traffic management system. With accurate forecasting, traffic can be effectively regulated, ensuring safe and fast journeys on the roads. 
In this session, Datatonic presents an end to end data science workflow which accurately forecasts congestion based on road sensor data from Transport for London (TfL).
The IoT (internet of things) nature and scale of the raw sensor data demands extensive preprocessing as the first step towards a predictive traffic model. We used Apache Beam for this task as it let us create efficient data pipelines which can be executed in distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark of Apache Flink. Beam natively handles streaming workloads which makes it an ideal candidate for large-scale preprocessing of real-time data such as streams from road sensors.

The preprocessed dataset was used to train a neural network to predict the congestion ahead of time. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was chosen to model the traffic time-series for each of the sensors. This deep learning architecture was implemented in Tensorflow and it allowed us to accurately model the time-series and the correlations between the sensors on the road network. With this end-to-end example, we demonstrate how Beam and Tensorflow can be used to build predictive models for time series data.
2. Investing with AI: ML@LSE x LSESU VC Society
Join us this Tuesday for an AI-themed panel with two high profile speakers - Roberto Bonanzinga, Managing Partner at InReach Ventures, and Eeswaran Navaratnam, Managing Partner at 01 Ventures.
InReach Ventures is a software-powered investment firm that uses AI and machine learning to develop a new model of investing. 01 Ventures is a new breed VC fund that focuses on early-stage companies developing deep technological solutions.
Structure of the 1-hour event:
• Q&A session
• Follow-up question round with audience members 
• 20 minutes of start-up pitching – our live Dragons’ Den

MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP IV: CODE A NEURAL NETWORK (VENUE: TBC, DATE: 14/2, TIME: 14:00 - 16:00)
Our FINAL bootcamp of the year has finally arrived! The final bootcamp will continue from where we left off in Bootcamp III, where we covered the key structure and learning roadmap of a Neural Network. We will be primarily using the ""TensorFlow"" package, an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs, developed by the Google Brain Team to build our own model. Based on feedbacks gathered in Michaelmas term, we have decided to limit the number of attendants for this bootcamp to ensure all participants receive sufficient assistance from our committee members. Therefore please submit your response only if you are close to certain that you will attend the Bootcamp.

TEXT AS DATA WITH PROFESSOR KEN BENOIT (VENUE: LSE LIFE ROOM 2, DATE: 21/2, TIME: 17:00 - 19:00)
Text mining and text analytics form increasingly important subsets ofdata science. This activity may be geared toward extracting value from commercial data, improving policy delivery, studying human speech, or analyzing literature or the arts. In this talk, Professor Ken will present a distinct perspective for analyzing text as data from a social science perspective, meaning that text is used as data for qualities that we cannot observe more directly. He will discuss the implications of this perspective, and provide examples from political and psychological sciences. The Professor will also provide an overview of some of the most important techniques of quantitative text analysis, with brief demonstrations.
---
Kenneth Benoit is Professor of Quantitative Social Research Methods, and Head of the Department of Methodology at the London School of Economics and Political Science.
He received his Ph.D. (1998) from Harvard University, Department of Government.
His current research focuses on automated, quantitative methods for processing large amounts of textual data, mainly political texts and social media. Current interest span from the analysis of big data, including social media, and methods of text mining. His substantive research in political science focuses on comparative party competition, the European Parliament, electoral systems, and the effects of campaign spending. His other methodological interests include general statistical methods for the social sciences, especially those relating to measurement. Recent datalarge-scale measurement projects in which he has been involved include estimating policy positions of political parties through crowd-sourceddata, expert surveys, manifesto coding, and text analysis.
Professor Benoit also works occasionally as a consultant for political parties, governmental organizations, and media for all business related to elections, especially computer modeling and forecasting of election outcomes.
We look forward to seeing you there.

The slides used today can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T5iCAM8TGloI-hS9STNcpueMfzJrTnZb/view?usp=sharing
Resources:
Here are some additional resources that you may find helpful for understanding feed-forward neural networks, and related applied issues:

Test out different Architectures: playground.tensorflow.org/ 
Neural Networks applied to image recognition: http://yosinski.com/deepvis
Correction:
We also stand corrected about the comment about the comment that generally, the more number of layers, the better the neural network. Having too many layers may cause problems for optimisation via gradient descent - it may cease to be useful as an algorithm to update weights. See: https://ayearofai.com/rohan-4-the-vanishing-gradient-problem-ec68f76ffb9b  
Our next bootcamp will be happening on 14 February 2018 (Wednesday) and we will be implementing a neural network using the Tensorflow package on Python. Please stay tuned to our Facebook for the sign up form and further updates
