Recently, the committee has been considering renaming the society to the LSESU Data Science Society. We believe that the new name would appeal to the wider LSE population as it encompasses aspects of Machine Learning, Statistics, and Mathematics while also being a very well known term. Before making this decision, however, we also want to see how our members feel about this proposal. Hence, we decided to make a poll so that our members could vote on whichever name that they prefer.

Please vote on a name for the society for the upcoming year! The committee will be taking this poll into consideration when we make a final decision. If possible, we would appreciate if you could also leave the rationale behind your vote in the comments below.

Introducing our new *Data Science Incubator Programme* 👩‍🔬

You will work in a small team of students with similar experience to you. You will be mentored by another student with knowledge regarding the problem you are working on. The main aim is to teach you the principles of Data Science and Machine Learning, and get you applying them straight away by working on a project you care about. The only prerequisites are that you know how to code (basics) in Python, and that you are able to dedicate 5 to 7 hours a week through MT and prehaps early LT contingent on progress.

If you meet these requirements, we welcome you to submit your details in the form linked below, so that we can organise the first meeting with your team. Form: https://forms.gle/UQ9mZBNLcrf5MUw37

Artificial Neural Networks - they are not as scary as they sound! Have you ever wanted to build them to solve some of the world's most interesting problems, but haven't had the time, or have been confused with the apparent complexity of them?
Our new course: &quot;A Practical Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks for Finance&quot; covers all of this.
We aim to get you building models very quickly, while sidestepping the mathematical detail and focusing on the intuition and practical side. You need to know how to code in Python, as well as some basic familiarity with the basic scientific packages NumPy and Pandas

It is understandable as it's the first time the SU has implemented such a system. Here is a step-by-step guide to casting your vote for the ML@LSE committee for 2019/20:

1) Open the link to our society on the LSESU website: https://www.lsesu.com/activities/societies/society/12940/

(if the link doesn't work go to lsesu.com and find &quot;Machine Learning&quot; under Societies)

You should see the society page like the one on the first image attached.

2) Log in using your LSE ID and password on the top right corner of the page.

3) After logging in, scroll down to see the voting section like the one on the second image attached and click VOTE NOW

4) Rank the candidates accordingly and hit submit. Make sure you've seen the posters and read the manifestos on the fb page before you vote.

5) Wait for results coming out next week.

NOTE: You must be a member of the society to vote, otherwise system simply wouldn't let you. Also, even if you are a member, if you joined quite recently, you also may not have voting rights.

Predicting congestion is an important part of any traffic management system. With accurate forecasting, traffic can be effectively regulated, ensuring safe and fast journeys on the roads. 

In this session, Datatonic presents an end to end data science workflow which accurately forecasts congestion based on road sensor data from Transport for London (TfL).

The IoT (internet of things) nature and scale of the raw sensor data demands extensive preprocessing as the first step towards a predictive traffic model. We used Apache Beam for this task as it let us create efficient data pipelines which can be executed in distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark of Apache Flink. Beam natively handles streaming workloads which makes it an ideal candidate for large-scale preprocessing of real-time data such as streams from road sensors.

The preprocessed dataset was used to train a neural network to predict the congestion ahead of time. A recurrent neural network (RNN) was chosen to model the traffic time-series for each of the sensors. This deep learning architecture was implemented in Tensorflow and it allowed us to accurately model the time-series and the correlations between the sensors on the road network. With this end-to-end example, we demonstrate how Beam and Tensorflow can be used to build predictive models for time series data.",Link,,,2018-02-23 07:06:42, ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kenneth Benoit is Professor of Quantitative Social Research Methods, and Head of the Department of Methodology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. 

He received his Ph.D. (1998) from Harvard University, Department of Government.

His current research focuses on automated, quantitative methods for processing large amounts of textual data, mainly political texts and social media. Current interest span from the analysis of big data, including social media, and methods of text mining. His substantive research in political science focuses on comparative party competition, the European Parliament, electoral systems, and the effects of campaign spending. His other methodological interests include general statistical methods for the social sciences, especially those relating to measurement. Recent data large-scale measurement projects in which he has been involved include estimating policy positions of political parties through crowd-sourced data, expert surveys, manifesto coding, and text analysis.

Professor Benoit also works occasionally as a consultant for political parties, governmental organizations, and media for all business related to elections, especially computer modeling and forecasting of election outcomes.",Link,,,2018-02-19 10:56:34, ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deep Learning Models, otherwise known as Neural Networks, are Machine Learning algorithms that mimic the computational structure of human brains. They are widely employed by AI pioneers to build facial recognition algorithms (Apple FaceID, Google Photos) and self-driving cars (Tesla, Fiat Chrysler). In this Bootcamp, we would explain in detail the internal operations of Deep Learning models: activation criteria, back-propagation, how they differ from traditional supervised learning techniques and challenges in real life applications.

Happy New Year! We hope you have had a refreshing vacation over your Christmas Break. Continuing from our series of successful event launches in Michaelmas term, we are excited to give you a glimpse of some of ML@LSE's selected Lent Term events coming down the pike. 

To kick start Lent Term, ML@LSE has invited Marc Cohen, representative from Google, to demonstrate how programmers can make use of packages and APIs and developed by Google Cloud to build an image classifier. 

Next up, Our Bootcamp series (III &amp; IV) will continue in mid-February, exploring various Neural Network Models (Deep Learning) and their applications. In the first session, we will delve into the basic structure and theory that underpin Feed-Forward Neural Networks, explaining how they differ from traditional Supervised Learning techniques. The second session is dedicated to a small number of keen coders, helping them to build their own  FF Neural Network model using the Tensorflow package developed by Google. 

Currently, we are in the process of planning an ML x Philosophy Panel Discussion following suggestions &amp; feedbacks from our Michaelmas Term survey. More details will be published closer to the date, please check for updates on our Facebook Page and Newsletters.

Hope to see you there!

----
Event Description:
Bias is an increasingly observed phenomenon in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning: From gender bias in online search to racial bias in court bail pleas to biases in worldviews depicted in personalized newsfeeds. How are societal biases creeping into the seemingly “objective’’ world of computers and programs? At the core, what is powering today’s AI are algorithms for fundamental computational problems such as classification, data summarization, and online learning. Such algorithms have traditionally been designed with the goal of maximizing some notion of “utility” and identifying or controlling bias in their output has not been a consideration. In this talk, Nisheeth and Elisa will explain the emergence of bias in algorithmic decision making and present the first steps towards developing a systematic framework to control biases in several of the aforementioned problems. This leads to new algorithms that have the ability to control and alleviate bias, often without a significant compromise to the utility that the current algorithms obtain.",Photo,,,2017-11-26 08:33:40, ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge

During our bootcamps and speakers’ events at ML@LSE, we put strong emphasis on how Machine Learning leverages Big Data to perform classification, regression and clustering. The requirement for mass human input and knowledge inevitably limited Machine Learning’s power and the types of domain it operates in. However, such constraint no longer applies to the Google’s AlphaGo Zero. AlphaGo Zero is the latest incarnation of its Go-playing automation developed by Deepmind. The algorithm is based solely on Reinforcement Learning, without human guidance, data or domain knowledge beyond basic game rules. The core idea that underpins such leap forward advancement in Machine Learning is the combined use of semi-randomized search functions and Neural Networks: Instead of playing against professional players, AlphaGo Zero plays against itself and iterates such process for millions of times. This article attached sheds light on AlphaGo Zero’s underlying concepts and its performance relative to previous generation AlphaGos. ML@LSE's mission is to empower LSE students with technical Machine Learning skills and provide a platform for intellectual discourses surrounding Machine Learning's trends, impacts and risks.

Shamus has over 23 years’ experience in Back Office transformation cross-industry and a broad in-field knowledge of undertaking Operational Strategy work for various global clients, from Investment Banks through to major Leisure companies. In 1993 he disrupted the BPO industry by building the first multi-function, multi-client BPO business. Shamus later joined PWC Consulting as a Financial Services Partner before that was acquired by IBM. He then went on to build IBM's first BPO operation in India and followed that by building dozens of Shared Service Centres around the world and in 2004/5 was managing a series of centres with 17,000 staff in Asia, Europe and the Americas, delivering Banking Operations, Insurance Claims, Finance, HR, Procurement and Call Centre services to clients globally. With the emergence of advanced automation Shamus is now leading the Automation Proposition covering everything from advanced robotics all the way through to Cognitive Computing. And all this in addition to his 120 km a week cycling addiction.

Thanks to everyone for coming down to ML@LSE Bootcamp I: Support Vector Machines. We hope all attendees took away some valuable lessons despite the tight timeframe we were working with. 

As we mentioned during the bootcamp, it is extremely important to understand the bias-variance decomposition, and the relationship between a model’s training error and its test error. In the context of machine learning and building predictive models, we are primarily interested in minimising the test error. The model with the lowest training error may not always be the best model because it may “overfit” to the noise of the training data. We may therefore need to implement some form of variable selection or regularisation - the underlying motivation is to reduce the test error by trading of some bias in return for a reduction in variance. The article below explains these concepts in greater detail. For those who are interested, you can read up more about popular regularisation methods applied to linear regression, such as ridge regression and lasso regression.",Link,,,2017-11-02 15:00:55, ,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Big Data? Artificial Intelligence? Machine Learning (ML)? These remain to be buzz words from Silicon Valley to common LSE folks. The paradigm shift propelled by ML have been rapidly reshaping social science, economics and finance. With the information explosion and emergence of new ML methods such as Neural networks, support vector machines etc. academics are compelled to rethink traditional research methodologies. In light of such trends, we (Kevin Lim, Jaume Vives and George Green) co-founded ML@LSE to address the broadening interface between ML and courses taught at LSE. ML@LSE’s mission is to position LSE students in the technology frontier by empowering them with practical ML tools in Python to be able to understand and deploy them to solve data driven questions.
